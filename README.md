# PingPongBot
3D printed ping pong server robot

I have used this dev board:
https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/Atmel/SAM3-H256/

ESP8266 was used for the WiFi communication.

Additional schematic is not availble since I have soldered this on a prototyping board. However it is easy to figure out how pins must be connected.
